> Enhance your game's conditions. Make them be applied automatically via a set of triggers, run a macro when they are applied/removed and other goodies.

# Features

## Enhanced Conditions

<details>
  <summary>Click to show</summary>

![enhanced-conditions](https://github.com/death-save/media/blob/master/combat-utility-belt/enhanced-conditions.gif)

It's not enough to _show_ your players when they're poisoned, you want to really drive it home by linking the condition so they can wallow in misery as they fail their ability checks.

This gadget creates a dynamo-powered link between status effect icons and reference entries (Journal, Item, or compendium) with further info on that status effect.

</details>

## Triggler

<details>
  <summary>Click to show</summary>

Trigger the addition or removal of Conditions, and/or the execution of Macros based on changes to actor/token properties such as HP
